# io4edge-client-c
C/C++ client sdk for io4edge.

[io4edge devices](https://docs.ci4rail.com/edge-solutions/io4edge/) are intelligent I/O devices invented by [Ci4Rail](https://www.ci4rail.com), connected to the host via network.

This library provides support for the following function blocks within io4edge devices:
* Analog In TypeA - IOU01, MIO01
* Binary IO TypeA - IOU01, MIO01
* MVB Sniffer - IOU03, MIO03

Currently not supported, but will follow:
* CAN Layer2 - IOU03, MIO03, IOU04, MIO04, IOU06
* Binary IO TypeC - IOU07
* Binary IO TypeB - IOU06
* Motion Sensor - CPU01UC

Not planned: Support for io4edge management functions, such as firmware update. Please use [io4edge-client-go](http://github.com/ci4rail/io4edge-client-go) for this.

## Restrictions: 

* Service addressing via MDNS is currently not supported. Please use the IP address and port of the io4edge device.
* Currently compiles on Linux only. CMakelists.txt needs to be adapted for other platforms.
* Only a static library is built.
* Tested under Ubuntu 22.04 and 20.04. 

## Build and Installation

Please build this library from source. The following dependencies are required:

### protobuf-c

Please install [protobuf-c](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c) first. 

For example, when using Ubuntu, you can install it like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends gcc g++ git automake libtool make cmake pkg-config libprotobuf-dev libprotoc-dev protobuf-compiler ca-certificates

git clone https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c.git 
cd protobuf-c && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make 
sudo make install 
sudo ldconfig
```

### Building 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ci4rail/io4edge-client-c.git --recursive
cd io4edge-client-c

mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && cmake --build .
```

### Installation

```bash 
cd build
sudo cmake --install .
```
### Usage

See [examples in github repo](./examples) for usage examples.

### Using the library outside of the project

```bash
gcc -o example example.c -lio4edge -lpthread -lrt -lprotobuf-c
```

or build a static linked binary, that has no dependencies to runtime libraries:

```bash
gcc -o example example.c -static -lio4edge -lpthread -lrt -lprotobuf-c
```
Even though the library is statically linked, you might run into problems with host name resolution, for example if you run the binary on a target whose glibc version does not match the host used to compile the binary. Use IP addresses instead of host names then.

## Development

When using vscode, open this repo in a [devcontainer](./.devcontainer). This will install all required dependencies.

### Build for debug
    
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 ..
cmake --build .
```
### Running tests

```bash
cd build
make test
```

### Creating a new functionblock client

Copy the closest existing functionblock client, and run [this script](./scripts/rename.sh), e.g.

```bash
scripts/rename.sh src/include/io4edge_analogintypea.h binaryIoTypeA analogInTypeA
scripts/rename.sh src/analogintypea.c binaryIoTypeA analogInTypeA  
```
